## Description
- In this code I changed many elements to make the webpage more accessible such as giving the page a title
-Changing the &lt;div&gt; elements to more semantic tags starting with the &lt;div&gt; that contained the header to &lt;header&gt;. The &lt;div&gt; that contained the nav to &lt;nav&gt;. The section that contained the content to a &lt;section&gt; and all the &lt;div&gt; elements within to &lt;article&gt; tags. The side bar element to &lt;aside&gt; and the content within it to &lt;main&gt;. And finally changed the footer tags to &lt;footer&gt;.
- Next I gave all the images alt names.
- Added an id to the search-engine-optimization anchor
- Created a single class for all of the elements that have the same styles class="main-source" and class="side-bar"
- Decreased the size of the images to help the webpage load faster
- Updated and consolidated the stylesheet to make sure all the original code would still be implemented without changing the look of the webpage
